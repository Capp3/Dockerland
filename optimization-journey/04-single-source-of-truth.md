# ðŸ”„ OPTIMIZATION ROUND 4: SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH IMPLEMENTATION

## ðŸš¨ Key Issues Identified
1. Despite introducing tasks.md, the system still instructed updating task status in multiple files
2. Dual-file update process (both .cursorrules AND activeContext.md) created synchronization errors
3. Complex command verification with nested if-statements caused terminal crashes
4. Inconsistent documentation references confused task tracking

## âœ… Key Improvements
1. **True Single Source of Truth**
   - Designated tasks.md as the ONLY file for task status tracking
   - Removed all instructions to update task status in .cursorrules
   - Modified all files to reference but not duplicate task information
   - Added explicit verification for tasks.md existence

2. **Command Execution Safety**
   - Simplified file verification processes to avoid terminal crashes
   - Removed nested if-statements in Windows batch commands
   - Added safer versions of common commands
   - Trusted the AI's existing knowledge of file operations

3. **Documentation Role Clarification**
   - .cursorrules: Project patterns and intelligence only
   - activeContext.md: Implementation details and current focus
   - progress.md: Overall progress and references to tasks
   - tasks.md: All task status tracking

4. **Technical Fixes**
   - Corrected MDC reference links in main.mdc
   - Fixed verification checklist for single source approach
   - Enhanced platform-specific documentation
   - Simplified real-time update formats
