# üìù KEY LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Context Efficiency is Mission-Critical**
   - Context window optimization directly impacts AI performance
   - Selective document loading preserves context for complex processing
   - Visual patterns require significantly less context space than text
   - Single source of truth eliminates redundant information loading

2. **Visual Processing Dramatically Reduces Cognitive Load**
   - Visual information processing is ~60,000√ó faster than text
   - Pattern recognition enables rapid process state awareness
   - Visual hierarchies improve information density
   - Standardized visual markers reduce context requirements

3. **Selective Loading Beats Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Loading only phase-relevant documents preserves context space
   - Just-in-time reference loading prevents context overconsumption
   - Complexity-based document loading scales efficiently
   - Reference-based systems outperform duplication-based systems

4. **Process Enforcement Requires Minimal Context**
   - Visual checkpoints provide efficient verification
   - Compact process state tracking preserves context
   - Pattern-based violation detection requires minimal overhead
   - Visual alerts communicate efficiently without verbose explanation

5. **Continuous Context Optimization Drives Performance**
   - Regular context window assessments reveal optimization opportunities
   - Context monitoring enables dynamic adjustments
   - Minimal mode provides fallback for extreme constraints
   - Context-aware process scaling adapts to available resources
