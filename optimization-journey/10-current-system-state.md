# ðŸ“š CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

The Memory Bank System now features:

1. **Context-Optimized Visual Navigation**
   - Selective document loading based on current phase
   - Visual process maps requiring minimal context space
   - Phase-specific document lists to prevent context overconsumption
   - Pattern-based information processing for cognitive efficiency

2. **7 Core Files with Optimal Loading**
   - projectbrief.md - Loaded selectively at initialization
   - productContext.md - Referenced only when needed
   - activeContext.md - Loaded during current task focus
   - systemPatterns.md - Referenced for architectural decisions
   - techContext.md - Loaded for technology-specific guidance
   - progress.md - Referenced for status updates
   - tasks.md - Single source of truth, consistently maintained

3. **Context-Efficient Creative Phase System**
   - Visual markers requiring minimal context space
   - Standardized format with optimized information density
   - Compact decision matrices for option evaluation
   - Visual enforcement requiring minimal context overhead

4. **Context-Aware Process Enforcement**
   - Visual checkpoints consuming minimal context space
   - Compact violation detection and correction mechanisms
   - Pattern-based verification for efficient processing
   - Reference-based guidance rather than duplication

5. **Dynamic Context Management**
   - Real-time context window usage optimization
   - Minimal mode for constrained operations
   - Automated document unloading for non-essential information
   - Visual references replacing full document loading
