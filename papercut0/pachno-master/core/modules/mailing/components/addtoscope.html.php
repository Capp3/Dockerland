    Hi, <?php echo $user->getBuddyname(); ?>!<br>
    Your user (<?php echo $user->getUsername(); ?>) registered at <?php echo $module->generateURL('home'); ?> has been added to a new scope in Pachno.<br>
    <br>
    Before you can log in to the new scope (located at the following URL(s): http://<?php echo join(', http://', $scope->getHostnames()); ?>, you need to confirm that you want to be added to that scope.<br>
    <br>
    By accepting the scope membership, you're also granting read+write access to the user details registered in Pachno to the scope administrator(s) in the new scope.<br>
    Don't worry, though, your main account will always be active and you can always disable the new scope access from your account page.<br>
    <br>
    To accept (or reject) this invitation, go to <?php echo $module->generateURL('home'); ?> and log in to your account.<br>
    Then, on your account page, use the "Scope memberships" tab to manage your scope memberships.<br>
</div>
