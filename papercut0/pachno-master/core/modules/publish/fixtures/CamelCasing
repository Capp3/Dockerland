'''!CamelCase''' (also spelled "camel case") or ''medial capitals'' is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are joined without spaces, with each element's initial letter capitalized within the compound, and the first letter can be upper or lower case â€” as in !LaBelle, !BackColor, !MacGyver, or iPod.

The name comes from the uppercase "bumps" in the middle of the compound word, suggestive of the humps of a camel.

The practice is also known by many other names, such as '''!BumpCaps''', '''!BeefCaps''', '''!CapWords''' and '''!WikiWords'''.
