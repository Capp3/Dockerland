          Firstly we need to create your user account so that access is secure.
          As this is the first account on the system it will have extra admin
          permissions for doing things like creating libraries on the local file
          system and adding additional users.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should generate a secure password and keep it stored somewhere
          safe as there is no way to recover it if you forget it.
        </p>
      </div>
