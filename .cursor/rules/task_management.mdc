# Task Management Rules

## Task List Review Protocol

1. **After Each Interaction:**
   - Review the current task list in `docs/tasks.md`
   - Check for any completed tasks based on the current interaction
   - Identify any new tasks that emerged from the interaction
   - Update task statuses accordingly

2. **Task Status Updates:**
   - Mark tasks as completed [x] when they are fully implemented and tested
   - Add new tasks with clear descriptions and checkboxes [ ]
   - Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section if appropriate
   - Update blocked tasks status if any blockers are resolved

3. **Task Documentation:**
   - New tasks should include:
     - Clear, specific description
     - Relevant subtasks if applicable
     - Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
     - Any dependencies on other tasks
   - Completed tasks should include:
     - Date of completion
     - Brief description of implementation
     - Any follow-up tasks created

4. **Task Organization:**
   - Keep tasks organized by module/feature
   - Maintain clear priority levels
   - Group related tasks together
   - Keep the task list focused and manageable

5. **Review Process:**
   - Verify task completion criteria are met
   - Ensure new tasks are properly scoped
   - Check for task dependencies
   - Validate task priorities
   - Update documentation as needed

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Task Updates:**
   - Make updates directly in `docs/tasks.md`
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Include clear commit messages for task updates
   - Document any significant changes in task status

2. **Task Creation:**
   - Create tasks for all identified work
   - Break down large tasks into manageable subtasks
   - Assign appropriate priority levels
   - Consider dependencies and prerequisites

3. **Task Completion:**
   - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
   - Ensure proper testing is completed
   - Document any follow-up work needed
   - Update related documentation

4. **Task Review:**
   - Review task list at the start of each interaction
   - Check for blocked tasks
   - Verify task priorities are still accurate
   - Ensure task descriptions are clear and up-to-date

Remember: Regular task list maintenance is crucial for project tracking and success. Keep the task list current and accurate.
