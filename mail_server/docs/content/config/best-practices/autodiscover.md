Email auto-discovery means a client email is able to automagically find out about what ports and security options to use, based on the mail-server URI. It can help simplify the tedious / confusing task of adding own's email account for non-tech savvy users.

Email clients will search for auto-discoverable settings and prefill almost everything when a user enters its email address :heart:

There exists [autodiscover-email-settings](https://hub.docker.com/r/monogramm/autodiscover-email-settings/) on which provides IMAP/POP/SMTP/LDAP autodiscover capabilities on Microsoft Outlook/Apple Mail, autoconfig capabilities for Thunderbird or kmail and configuration profiles for iOS/Apple Mail.
