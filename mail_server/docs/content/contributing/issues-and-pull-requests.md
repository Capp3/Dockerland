!!! question "Motivation"

    You want to add a feature? Feel free to start creating an issue explaining what you want to do and how you're thinking doing it. Other users may have the same need and collaboration may lead to better results.

The development workflow is the following:

   1. Create a new branch to work on
   2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. Write the code that is needed :D
3. Add integration tests if necessary
4. [Prepare your environment and run linting and tests][docs-tests]
5. Document your improvements if necessary (e.g. if you introduced new environment variables, describe those in the [ENV documentation][docs-environment])
6. [Commit][commit] and [sign your commit][gpg], push and create a pull-request to merge into `master`. Please **use the pull-request template** to provide a minimum of contextual information and make sure to meet the requirements of the checklist.
