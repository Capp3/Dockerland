# Changelog

## `v10.2.0`

- You no longer need to maintain a copy of `setup.sh` matching your version release from v10.2 of `docker-mailserver` onwards. Version specific functionality of `setup.sh` has moved into the container itself, while `setup.sh` remains as a convenient wrapper to: `docker exec -it <container name> setup <command>`.
- [`ONE_DIR`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#one_dir) now defaults to enabled (`1`).
- For anyone relying on internal location of certificates (_internal copy of mounted files at startup_), the Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`. This may affect any third-party `user-patches.sh` scripts that depended on this path to update certs.
- The [_Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/security/ssl#lets-encrypt-recommended) has been brought up to date.

### Bigger scripts-related improvements

- **[scripts]** update `setup.sh` to now use a running container first if one exists [#2134](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2134)
- **[scripts]** included `setup.sh` functionality inside the container to be version independent again [#2174](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2174)
- **[scripts]** `HOSTNAME` and `DOMAINNAME` setup improved [#2175](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2175)
- **[scripts]** `delmailuser` can now delete mailboxed without TLD [#2172](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2172)
- **[scripts]** properly exit on failure ([#2199](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2199) in conjunction with [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196))
- **[scripts]** make `setup.sh` completely non-interactive for Podman users [#2201](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2201)

### Security

Some internal refactoring and fixes happened this release cycle in [#2196](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2196):

- **[improve]** The Postfix and Dovecot location of `/etc/postfix/ssl` has changed to `/etc/dms/tls`
- **[improve]** An invalid `SSL_TYPE` or a valid value with an invalid configuration will now panic, exiting the container and emitting a fatal error to the logs
- **[fix]** An unconfigured/empty `SSL_TYPE` ENV now correctly disables SSL support for Dovecot and general Postfix configurations. A reminder that this is unsupported officially, and is only intended for tests and troubleshooting. Use only [a valid `SSL_TYPE`](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/v10.2/config/environment/#ssl_type) (_`letsencrypt` and `manual` are recommended_) for production deployments
- **[fix]** `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` now modifies the system (container) `openssl.cnf` config to set the minimum protocol to TLS 1.0 (_from 1.2_) and cipher-suite support to `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=1` (_from `2`_). This change is required for Dovecot in upcoming Debian Bullseye upgrade, to be compatible with the `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` cipher-suite profile. It may affect other software within the container that relies on this openssl config, should you extend the Docker image [#2193](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2193)
- **[fix]** Provide DH parameters (_default: RFC 7919 group `ffdhe406.pem`_) at build-time, instead of during startup. Custom DH parameters regardless of `ONE_DIR` are now only detected when mounted to `/tmp/docker-mailserver/dhparams.pem` [#2192](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2192)
- **[docs]** Revise the _Let's Encrypt_ section of our SSL / TLS docs [#2209](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2209)

### Miscellaneous small additions and changes

- **[ci]** improved caching [#2197](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2197)
- **[ci]** refactored spam tests and introduced common container setup template [#2198](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2198)

- **[general]** Fixed many prose errors (spelling, grammar, indentation).
- **[general]** Documentation is better integrated into the development process and it's visibility within the project increased ([#1878](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1878)).
- **[general]** Added `stop_grace_period:` to example Compose file and supervisord ([#1896](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1896) [#1945](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1945))
- **[general]** `./setup.sh email list` was enhanced, now showing information neatly ([#1898](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1898))
- **[general]** Added update check and notification ([#1976](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1976), [#1951](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1951))
- **[general]** Moved environment variables to the documentation and improvements ([#1948](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1948), [#1947](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1947), [#1931](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1931))
- **[security]** Major Fail2Ban improvements (cleanup, update and breaking changes, see below)
- **[fix]** `./setup.sh email del ...` now works properly 
- **[code]** Added color variables to `setup.sh` and improved the script as a whole ([#1879](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1879), [#1886](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1886))
- **[ldap]** Added `LDAP_QUERY_FILTER_SENDERS` ([#1902](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1902))
- **[ldap]** Use dovecots LDAP `uris` connect option instead of `hosts` ([#1901](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1901))

- **[docs]** PRs that contain changes to docs will now be commented with a preview link ([#1988](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1988))

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** Fail2Ban adjustments:
  - Fail2ban v0.11.2 is now used ([#1965](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1965)).
  - The previous F2B config (from an old Debian release) has been replaced with the latest default config for F2B shipped by Debian 10.
  - The new default blocktype is now `DROP`, not `REJECT` ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - A ban now applies to all ports (`iptables-allports`), not just the ones that were "attacked" ([#1914](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1914)).
  - Fail2ban 0.11 is totally compatible to 0.10, but the database got some new tables and fields (auto-converted during the first start), so once updated to DMS 10.0.0, you have to remove the database `mailstate:/lib-fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3` if you would need to downgrade to DMS 9.1.0 for some reason.
- **[ldap]** Removed `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SSL`. Instead provide a protocol in `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_SERVER` and adjust `SASLAUTHD_LDAP_` default values ([#1989](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1989)).
- **[general]** Removed `stable` release tag ([#1975](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1975)):
  - Scheduled builds are now based off `edge`.
  - Instead of `stable`, please use the latest version tag available (_or the `latest` tag_).
  - The `stable` image tag will be removed from DockerHub in the near future.
- **[setup]** Removed `./setup config ssl` command (_deprecated since v9_). `SSL_TYPE=self-signed` remains supported however. ([`dc8f49de`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/commit/dc8f49de548e2c2e2aa321841585153a99cd3858), [#2021](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/2021))

## `v9.1.0`

This release marks the breakpoint where the wiki was transferred to a [reworked documentation](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/)

- **[feat]** Introduce ENABLE_AMAVIS env ([#1866](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1866))
- **[docs]** Move wiki to gh-pages ([#1826](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1826)) - Special thanks to @polarathene 👨🏻‍💻
  - You can [edit the docs](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/tree/master/docs/content) now directly with your code changes
  - Documentation is now versioned related to docker image versions and viewable here: <https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/>

## `v9.0.1`

A small update on the notification function which was made more stable as well as minor fixes.

- **[fix]** `_notify` cannot fail anymore - non-zero returns lead to unintended behavior in the past when `DMS_DEBUG` was not set or `0`
- **[refactor]** `check-for-changes.sh` now uses `_notify`

## `v9.0.0`

- **[feat]** Support extra `user_attributes` in accounts configuration ([#1792](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1792))
- **[feat]** Add possibility to use a custom dkim selector ([#1811](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1811))
- **[feat]** TLS: Dual (aka hybrid) certificate support! (eg ECDSA certificate with an RSA fallback for broader compatibility) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
  - This feature is presently only for `SSL_TYPE=manual`, all you need to do is provide your fallback certificate to the `SSL_ALT_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_ALT_KEY_PATH` ENV vars, just like your primary certificate would be setup for manual mode.
- **[security]** TLS: You can now use ECDSA certificates! ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802))
  - Warning: ECDSA may not be supported by legacy systems (most pre-2014). You can provide an RSA certificate as a fallback.
- **[fix]** TLS: For some docker-compose setups when restarting the docker-mailserver container, internal config state may have been persisted despite making changes that should reconfigure TLS (eg changing `SSL_TYPE` or replacing the certificate file) ([#1801](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1801)).
- **[refactor]** Split `start-mailserver.sh` ([#1820](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1820))
- **[fix]** Linting now uses local path to remove the sudo dependency ([#1831](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1831)).

### Breaking Changes

- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` has changed the server-side preference order to 128-bit before 256-bit encryption ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: This is still very secure but may result in misleading lower scores/grades from security audit websites.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=modern` removed support for AES-CBC cipher suites and follows best practices by supporting only AEAD cipher suites ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: As TLS 1.2 is the minimum required for modern already, AEAD cipher suites should already be supported and preferred.
- **[security]** TLS: `TLS_LEVEL=intermediate` has removed support for cipher suites using RSA for key exchange (only available with an RSA certificate) ([#1802](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1802)).
  - NOTE: This only affects Dovecot which supported 5 extra cipher suites using AES-CBC and AES-GCM. Your users MUA clients should be unaffected, preferring ECDHE or DHE for key exchange.
- **[refactor]** Complete refactoring of opendkim script ([#1812](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/pull/1812)).
  - NOTE: Use `./setup.sh config dkim help` to see the new syntax.

## `v8.0.1`

This release is a hotfix for #1781.

- **[spam]** `bl.spamcop.net` was removed from the list of spam lists since the domain expired and became unusable
