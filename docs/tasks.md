9. Docker Compose Standardization
   - [x] Create tools to validate Docker Compose version (should be 3.8)
   - [x] Develop standardization script for service layouts
   - [x] Implement backup configuration for external data drives
   - [x] Ensure logging configuration is preserved
   - [x] Test Docker Compose standardization on sample files

## Creative Phases Required
- [x] TUI Navigation Flow Design
